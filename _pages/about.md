<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
Hi! I‚Äôm **Shuowen Li (ÊùéÁ°ïÊñá)**, currently a second-year M.S. student in Optical Engineering at the **Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University**, advised by Prof. [Liangcai Cao](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1133/1413.htm), and collaborating closely with Prof. [Haipeng Mi](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1691.htm) at the Academy of Arts & Design.

I‚Äôm broadly interested in **human-AI interaction**, **computational design**, and **creative robotics**. My recent work focuses on bridging intelligent systems and generative interfaces‚Äîparticularly how we can enable *semantic-driven evolution*, *co-creative storytelling*, and *affective interaction* in digital and physical lifeforms. I enjoy designing interactive systems that integrate AI, simulation, and physical prototyping, with the goal of empowering human creativity through computation.

My technical background spans **optical engineering**, **computational imaging**, and **interactive system design**, including work on lensless imaging, 3D display evaluation, and real-time astronomical image reconstruction. I‚Äôve published research in *Optics Express*, *Fundamental Research*, and *HRI*, and submitted papers to *SIGGRAPH Asia* and *TEI*.
