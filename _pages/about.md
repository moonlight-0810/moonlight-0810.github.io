## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m **Shuowen Li (李硕文)**, currently a second-year M.S. student in Optical Engineering at the **Department of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University**, advised by Prof. [Liangcai Cao](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1133/1413.htm), and collaborating closely with Prof. [Haipeng Mi](https://www.ad.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1046/1691.htm) at the Academy of Arts & Design.

I’m broadly interested in **human-AI interaction**, **computational design**, and **creative robotics**. My recent work focuses on bridging intelligent systems and generative interfaces—particularly how we can enable *semantic-driven evolution*, *co-creative storytelling*, and *affective interaction* in digital and physical lifeforms. I enjoy designing interactive systems that integrate AI, simulation, and physical prototyping, with the goal of empowering human creativity through computation.

My technical background spans **optical engineering**, **computational imaging**, and **interactive system design**, including work on lensless imaging, 3D display evaluation, and real-time astronomical image reconstruction. I’ve published research in *Optics Express*, *Fundamental Research*, and *HRI*, and submitted papers to *SIGGRAPH Asia* and *TEI*.

## 🧪 Projects

### 🧬 **Semantic-Guided Artificial Life System**

*Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University (2023–present)*

Developed a real-time interactive system where users evolve digital lifeforms using **natural language prompts**. Integrated **CLIP-based multimodal evaluation** and **CMA-ES optimization**, supporting both semantic guidance and emergent swarm behaviors. Enables participatory generative design in the spirit of "evolving with intention".

### 🤖 **PuppetLine: Swarm Robotic Storytelling**

*Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University (2024–present)*

Built a tangible storytelling system using **Toio robots** and **large language models (LLMs)**. Translates children’s narrative inputs into synchronized multi-robot actions and emotions. The system empowers **co-creative expression** through embodied interaction.

### ✋ **Embo: A Wearable Robot for Empathy Education**

*Academy of Arts & Design, Tsinghua University (2023)*

Designed a wearable puppet robot that transforms **verbal aggression** into **tactile pressure feedback**, addressing bullying scenarios in child–robot interaction. Combines **natural language analysis** and **haptic feedback** to build emotional awareness.

### 🌌 **Astronomical Image Reconstruction**

*Dept. of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University (2022–2025)*

Developed a GPU-accelerated pipeline for **turbulence removal** in single-frame astronomical images using **blind deconvolution**, **deformable convolution**, and **diffusion models**. Collaborated on hardware–software co-design with a **four-aperture telescope array**.

### 🖼️ **3D Display Quality Assessment**

*Dept. of Precision Instrument, Tsinghua University (2022–2024)*

Proposed a hybrid evaluation framework for **glasses-free 3D displays**, integrating **optical metrics** and **human visual comfort** analysis. Contributed to drafting **industry standards** for autostereoscopic display technologies.
