<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

Hi! I’m **Shuowen Li (李硕文)**, a second-year M.S. student in Optical Engineering at **Tsinghua University**, advised by Prof. Liangcai Cao. I also work as a research intern at the **Academy of Arts & Design**, mentored by Prof. Haipeng Mi. Previously, I received my B.S. in Physics from Lanzhou University, where I studied nanomaterial design under Prof. Hao Jia.

My research focuses on **human–AI interaction**, **computational imaging**, and **creative robotics**. I am interested in how intelligent systems can support human creativity by enabling semantic evolution, co-creative storytelling, and generative design. Combining science and art, I build interactive systems that help people create with AI in both digital and physical contexts.

Check out my [CV](../assets/CV_Shuowen_Li.pdf) for more!
